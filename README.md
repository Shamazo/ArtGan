## ArtGan

This is still a work in progress. I am still experimenting with architectures. This is loosely based on [InfoGan](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03657.pdf), but I am planning to use the [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) loss function rather than the [vanilla GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) loss function.
